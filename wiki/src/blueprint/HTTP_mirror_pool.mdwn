# Speed

This is mainly for [[!tails_ticket 10295]]. We keep this information
around because it provides potentially useful data wrt. the reasons
why we picked some mirrors, but not others, for the fallback DNS pool.

## Fast & reliable enough mirrors

i.e. those that I've seen provide good speed and that have had no
reliability issue in the last N months.

Note: measurements done from lizard are capped to 100Mbps due to
upstream network configuration, so they can barely be used to reliably
compare those fast mirrors with each other. For measurements done from
Germany, upstream network should not be the limiting factor for most
practical purposes here.

## Not reliable enough mirrors

i.e. mirrors that have had issues at least once in the last 6 months;
let's not include them in the fallback DNS pool:

* 5.196.175.179
* 77.70.69.9
  - from France: avg. 0.3 MB/s, stdev 0.1 MB/s â‡’ **TODO** remove from the pool?
* 80.90.43.162
* 84.106.196.237
* 86.59.119.84
* 109.239.48.152
* 137.226.34.46:
  - from lizard: 798 KB/s, 9.80MB/s, 2.08MB/s, 1.37MB/s
     connection closes in the middle of the download pretty often
  - from Germany: 8.73MB/s, 10.4MB/s, 12.2MB/s
  - from France: avg. 11.1 MB/s, stdev 2.5 MB/s
