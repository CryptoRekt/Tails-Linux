Intrigeris propsal on [tails-dev](https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-dev/2016-July/010822.html) was

# [[!tails_ticket 10113 desc="Greeter option to enable microphone"]]

It would be great to have the feature to have a disabled microphone without disabled sound. There
is the point, that also the speakers can be used as a microphone. jvoisin will do some research in
this direction and summarize that on the ticket. Then we can discuss this topic again.
