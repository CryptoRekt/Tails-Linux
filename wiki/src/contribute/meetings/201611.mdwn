# [[!tails_ticket 11859 desc="Trusting Tails Installer & Ubuntu PPA"]]

We decided that more info and in particular a clear user-story is
needed here. The user-story should make clear how users will use the
proposed solutions to improve security. The ticket will be set to
"Needs more info".

# [[!tails_ticket 11841 desc="Consider shipping libgail-common"]]

We decided that this is a can of worm that we should not open.
Many GTK applications produce spurious text on stdout, but this is in
general not a problem. So, this ticket will be rejected.
