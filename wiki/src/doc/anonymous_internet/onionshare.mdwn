[[!meta title="Sharing files with OnionShare"]]

Tails includes [OnionShare](https://onionshare.org/), a tool for anonymous
filesharing. It allows you to share files directly from your running Tails.
To do so, it creates a Hidden Service (a website whose address ends with *.onion*)
within the Tor network. Any Tor user who you give this address to
can download the files you decided to share.

To share files with <span class="application">OnionShare</span>:

1. Start the [[file browser|doc/first_steps/introduction_to_gnome_and_the_tails_desktop#nautilus]].

1. Right click on a file or folder in the file browser and
   choose <span class="guilabel">Share with OnionShare</span>.

1. If you want to add more files, drag and drop them into the window
   of <span class="application">OnionShare</span>.

1. If you want to allow multiple downloads, uncheck the
   <span class="guilabel">Stop sharing automatically</span>
   check box.
   Otherwise <span class="application">OnionShare</span> will stop
   sharing files after they have been downloaded once.

1. Click on <span class="guilabel">Start Sharing</span>.
   When the files are available, an address similar to
   *http://bwwijokny5qplq5q.onion/assam-cover* will be shown.

1. Now you can pass the address to anyone else, e.g. via e-mail.
   <span class="application">OnionShare</span> will inform you when
   the shared files are being accessed.

1. Once you close the <span class="application">OnionShare</span>
   application or shut down Tails, the files are not shared anymore.
